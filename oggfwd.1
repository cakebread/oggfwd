.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility acts as a minimal source client for Icecast servers.
It reads an Ogg stream from stdin and forwards it to a server specified on the
command line.
.Pp
The
.Ar address ,
.Ar port ,
.Ar password
and
.Ar mountpoint
arguments are mandatory and have to be given in that order.
.Ss Optional command line parameters
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl m Ar metadata file
Sets a file holding stream meta data.
.It Fl d Ar description
Set the stream description.
.It Fl g Ar genre
Set the stream genre.
.It Fl h
Print a short usage summay.
.It Fl n Ar name
Set the stream
.Pq i.e. radio
name.
.It Fl p
Allow the stream to be made public in stream directories.
.It Fl u Ar URL
Set the stream URL.
.It Fl T Ar TLS mode
This sets the TLS (encryption) mode. Valid values are "disabled" (no encryption), "auto" (any encryption if available), "auto_no_plain" (any encryption), "rfc2818" (encryption based on RFC2818) and "rfc2817" (encryption based on RFC2817). For most users the default mode "auto" should work just fine.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
reacts to the hangup signal, SIGHUP, by printing the amount of bytes read from
stdin to stdout at the next given opportunity.
How fast it reacts depends on the stream's current bitrate.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To forward a public Ogg stream with the name
.Dq Test radio
to an Icecast server, one would pipe that stream to an
.Nm
command line such as
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
oggfwd -p -n \&"Test radio\&" radio.example.com 8000 password /stream.ogg
.Ed
.Pp
Encode an Ogg Vorbis stream, dump it to disk and stream it at the same time:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
oggenc - < input.wav | tee streamdump.ogg \e
    | oggfwd radio.example.com 8000 password /stream.ogg

.Sh CAVEATS
Since the password to the Icecast server is given in clear text on the command
line, other
.Pq local
users will probably be able to see it very easily.
